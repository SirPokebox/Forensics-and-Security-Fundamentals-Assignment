# Forensics-and-Security-Fundamentals-Assignment
For this assigment I had to exploit the vulnerabilities within a server through a virtual machine that I set-up. The first part
of the assignment was to perform a system audit which entailed explaining what the Computer Misuse Act 1990 is and, explaining
how virtualisation can be used to prevent breaches of the act when security testing. I then had to deploy a vulnerable
web server within a virtual machine and carry out a scan against it within the terminal of the virtual machine. I then had to
report my findings of the open ports identified and provide screen captures as evidence. Once I found exploits I had to access
the https://www.cvedetails.com site and lookup two services I identified and explain how the vulnerability affected the
confidentiality, integrity or availability of the system. After that I then had to mitigate the vulnerabilities using an
Uncompicated Firewall by configuring the ports that were allowed/denied.
